# Decision log

Significant choices, newest last. Each entry: date, decision, why, alternatives rejected.

## 2026-06-12 — Stage 1 kickoff

- **Expo SDK 56 (latest stable at time of scaffold)**, TypeScript strict, `blank-typescript`
  template (no expo-router — V1 is a small number of screens; plain navigation keeps the
  frame path simple and avoids a dependency we don't need yet).
- **Continuous Native Generation (CNG):** `android/` and `ios/` are gitignored and produced by
  `npx expo prebuild`. The only native code we own lives in `modules/expo-pose-detection`.
- **MediaPipe model binaries are not committed.** `scripts/download-models.sh` fetches
  `pose_landmarker_lite.task` into the module's Android assets and iOS resources. Run it once
  after clone, before prebuild.
- **Pipeline is pure TS with zero React/Expo imports** (`src/pose/`), so the identical code
  runs on-device and in the headless replay CLI / Jest. This is what makes record/replay
  deterministic.
- **VIDEO running mode** (synchronous `detectForVideo`/`detect(videoFrame:)` on the camera
  analysis thread) with monotonic timestamps, per the transferred Forma learnings — not
  LIVE_STREAM mode.

## 2026-06-12 — Stage 1 implementation notes

- **react-native-svg (15.15.4) added** for the skeleton renderer. Rationale: one
  `setNativeProps({d})` call per path per frame (3 calls/frame total) beats 50+ positioned
  Views, and core `Animated` can't drive arbitrary path geometry. It's the lightest viable
  option given Reanimated is banned. Flagging per the "ask before heavy dependencies"
  agreement — swap out if vetoed.
- **tsx (dev-only)** runs the replay CLI and fixture generator directly from TS.
- **Native deps pinned:** MediaPipe `tasks-vision:0.10.35`, CameraX `1.6.1` (latest stable on
  Google Maven at setup time), `MediaPipeTasksVision ~> 0.10` pod.
- **Android lifecycle:** RN 0.85's dependency tree resolves the *Java* androidx.lifecycle API —
  `PoseDetectionView` overrides `getLifecycle()` and drives `LifecycleRegistry` via
  `handleLifecycleEvent` (the `currentState` setter doesn't exist there). If a future RN bumps
  to the Kotlin lifecycle API, this must flip to `override val lifecycle`.
- **Landmark event payload** is a flat 165-double array + timestamp; an **empty array still
  emits** per frame — the pipeline needs frame continuity to drive subject-gone detection.
- **Coordinates:** normalized [0..1], upright portrait, unmirrored on both platforms
  (Android rotates via MediaPipe `ImageProcessingOptions`, iOS rotates the capture
  connection). Front-camera mirroring is applied only in the renderer.
- **Camera analysis at 640×480** — the lite model downscales to 256px internally; higher
  capture resolution buys nothing but battery drain.
- **Fixture policy:** synthetic recordings + `.expected.json` summaries are committed and
  regenerated only via `npm run fixtures`; the diff is reviewed like code. Real device
  recordings get added as fixtures when behaviors surprise us (working agreement).
- **Pre-flight overlaps pipeline warmup** intentionally: warmup gates *counting*, not framing
  guidance. Lighting check measures jitter on the RAW frame (smoothing hides the signal).
- **Test-driven pipeline fixes:** chain reliability ramps over its window (no instant trust on
  frame 1); subject validity needs only 4 visible core landmarks (side views must stay
  valid); calibration stillness gate uses EMA'd hip speed (raw jitter was resetting it).
- **jest-expo:** don't override `transformIgnorePatterns` — the preset's default is what
  transforms expo-modules-core; overriding it breaks the test bootstrap.
- **Model binaries not committed** (5.7MB each, regenerable): `scripts/download-models.sh`
  must run after clone and before prebuild, or the app throws `model-not-bundled` at runtime.
- **APK model compression (caught in verification):** AGP Deflate-compresses `.task` assets by
  default and library-level `androidResources.noCompress` does NOT govern final APK packaging —
  MediaPipe mmaps models, so this breaks at runtime. Fixed with a config plugin
  (`modules/expo-pose-detection/app.plugin.js`) that injects `noCompress += ["task","tflite"]`
  into the generated app build.gradle; verified by `unzip -v` showing `Stored` for the asset.
  This is the predicted "MediaPipe gradle quirk" — the budget for it was real.

## 2026-06-13 — Stage 2: grading engine, chair stand, voice flow, noise floor

- **Grading primitives are signal-agnostic scalars.** The four archetypes (+RepVelocity)
  consume scalar signals (knee angle, hip height, hold booleans), not frames; movement
  definitions own landmark→signal extraction. Keeps the primitives reusable across all five
  assessment items and trivially unit-testable. Rejected: frame-consuming trackers (would
  couple every archetype to landmark layout).
- **Rep crediting = hysteresis commit at the TOP (down→up), re-arm at the bottom.** A rise
  that stalls between thresholds is an explicit `ascent-abort` (partial rises never count).
  `resetState()` re-anchors to 'unknown' on subject-gone, keeping credited reps — re-entry
  can't double-count (the Forma lesson, now load-bearing in tests).
- **Rise velocity uses the NEAR-SIDE hip, not the hip midpoint.** CLAUDE.md says "hip
  midpoint", but in a side view the far hip is occlusion garbage and would poison the
  midpoint. Same proxy semantics (vertical pelvis motion), more robust side-on; side
  selection is sticky while a rep is in flight so the signal can't hop sides mid-rise.
  Velocity is displacement/duration over the hysteresis-bounded concentric window — for the
  trend product, a *consistent* window beats a *complete* one.
- **Chair-stand thresholds:** knee angle up-enter 155° / down-enter 110° (seated ≈90°,
  standing ≈175°); tune only via replay recordings. Push-off = wrist within 0.15 bu of the
  hip→knee segment for ≥50% of rise frames — logged per rep, never voiced (product law 3).
- **expo-audio added** (SDK 56 canonical audio module) for bundled playback. Audio mode:
  `mixWithOthers` + recording disabled, configured at app start BEFORE the camera mounts —
  audio config must never interrupt the camera session. Voice channel plays one line at a
  time and DROPS lower-priority lines when busy (no stale queue); rep chime is a separate
  SFX channel.
- **Voice lines are committed assets** (~900 KB: 58 lines + chime), generated by
  `npm run audio` via macOS `say` (Samantha) + `afconvert`. Numbers 0–40 are bundled as
  separate words and results are stitched ("You completed" + "twelve" + "chair stands").
  Production voice = regenerate the same filenames with a pro TTS; the manifest
  (`src/audio/manifest.ts`) is generated to keep require() calls static for Metro.
- **Session controller is pure TS** driven by frame timestamps + a `voiceBusy` input from
  the player, so the entire voice-guided flow (preflight prompts → auto-start → countdown →
  30s window → spoken result) replays deterministically in Jest. The screen only plays cues
  and mirrors state at 10fps.
- **Noise-floor experiment** (docs/noise-floor-report.md): synthetic setup-variance dry run
  (same body, identical true velocity, varied distance/angle/placement/jitter) measures the
  chain's own contribution at **0.44% CV** vs **10.9% unnormalized** — body-unit
  normalization is load-bearing and now guarded by a regression test (CV ≤ 2%, ≥5× better
  than raw). Real-person recordings are still required for the go/no-go; protocol + pull/
  analysis tooling are in place (`scripts/pull-recordings.sh`, `npm run noise-floor`).
- **Synthetic chair-stand generator drives hip height, not joint angles** (two-link IK
  derives the knee angle), so true hip velocity is piecewise-linear and known exactly —
  that's what makes "velocity within tolerance" assertions honest.
